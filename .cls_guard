# CLS Guard — Critical Operational Constraints
# Created: 2025-01-21
# Status: ACTIVE

## CRITICAL RULES

1. **NEVER Auto-Sync/Auto-Commit/Auto-Run Git Commands**
   - CLS MUST NOT automatically sync, commit, or run any git commands
   - All git operations require explicit Work Order (WO)

2. **Work Order (WO) Required for Operations**
   - CLS ONLY executes operations when receiving a Work Order
   - No autonomous operations without WO authorization

3. **No System-Wide Workflow Triggers**
   - CLS MUST NOT trigger system-wide workflows
   - No automatic CI/CD, deployment, or batch operations

4. **Guard File Active Behavior**
   - When `.cls_guard` exists (this file):
     - CLS MUST ONLY execute patch operations
     - CLS MUST NEVER perform Git sync operations
     - All other operations require explicit WO

## Enforcement

This guard file is checked before any operation:
- If present → Patch operations only, NO Git sync
- All operations require Work Order authorization
- System-wide workflows are prohibited

## Governance Compliance

- Rule 91: Guard file in SOT root (read-only for CLS)
- Rule 92: All changes via WO only
- Rule 93: This guard is evidence of operational constraints
