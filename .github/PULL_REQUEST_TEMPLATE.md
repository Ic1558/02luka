## Summary
- What changed and why?

## Checklist
- [ ] Used mapping keys via path_resolver (no hardcoded paths)
- [ ] Ran `.codex/preflight.sh` locally
- [ ] `g/tools/mapping_drift_guard.sh --validate` passed or justified
- [ ] Updated docs if behavior changed (Boss flow / routing / LaunchAgents)

## Test Plan
- Steps to verify (include dropbox→inbox/sent→deliverables flow if relevant)

<!-- Add CI jobs later to run preflight.sh and mapping_drift_guard.sh --validate -->
