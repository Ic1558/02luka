# 🧠 CLS Phase 9.2 – System Governance & Auto-Recovery Kickoff

**Status:** 🟡 In Progress  
**Scope:** Governance Framework + Self-Healing Automation  
**Date:** 2025-10-22

## 🎯 Primary Objectives

| Goal | Target Outcome |
|------|----------------|
| 1 – Auto-Healing Mechanism | Automatic restart/recover for Worker and Bridge services on failure |
| 2 – Governance Dashboard | Unified view of agents (GG, GC, Mary, Paula, CLS, Hybrid) with status, roles & uptime |
| 3 – Alert Bridge Integration | Discord + Telegram notifications for health and failure events |
| 4 – Redundancy & Failover | Multi-node resilience via Cloudflare Tunnels and local fallback nodes |
| 5 – Daily Ops Cycle | Automated nightly verification and report export to g/reports/daily/ |

## ⚙️ Planned Implementation

### A. Auto-Recovery Subsystem
- Monitors critical processes (PID, health endpoint)
- Performs graceful restart on non-zero exit code
- Logs recovery events to g/telemetry/autoheal.log
- Includes optional Discord alert on restart

### B. Governance Dashboard
- Web-served interface (/ops/governance)
- Displays agent role map, health, and uptime history
- Integrates with Ops UI metrics backend
- Supports manual disable/enable per agent

### C. Alert Bridge
- Unified alert router to Discord + Telegram
- Customizable severity levels (INFO/WARN/CRIT)
- Daily digest reports at 09:00 via LaunchAgent

### D. Redundancy & Failover
- Mirrored Worker instances (ops-backup.workers.dev)
- Load-balancing via Cloudflare Routes
- Local fallback to Mini PC agent if primary offline

### E. Daily Ops Cycle
- Scheduled via LaunchAgent 09:00 and 21:00
- Runs health tests + memory sync + report generation
- Output: /Volumes/lukadata/CLS/reports/daily/CLS_DAILY_<date>.log

## 🧾 Deliverables
1. **autoheal_daemon.cjs** → Process monitor + self-restart
2. **governance_dashboard.cjs** → Role overview UI
3. **alert_bridge.cjs** → Discord + Telegram bridge
4. **launchd_com.02luka.cls.autoheal.plist** → macOS LaunchAgent
5. **Documentation** → g/reports/CLS_GOVERNANCE_MANUAL.md

## 🧩 Timeline

| Phase | Target | Owner |
|-------|--------|-------|
| 9.2-A – Auto-Heal Core | Day 1-2 | CLS Agent |
| 9.2-B – Dashboard UI | Day 3-4 | CLS + GG |
| 9.2-C – Alerts & Reports | Day 5 | CLS + Mary |
| 9.2-D – Failover Validation | Day 6 | GG + Hybrid |
| 9.2-E – Full System Test | Day 7 | CLS + Mary + GG |

## ✅ Success Criteria
- Auto-heal success rate ≥ 98% (over 48h)
- Governance UI latency < 250ms
- Alert Bridge delivery < 3s
- No unplanned downtime > 2min
- Daily report auto-generated and verified

## 📈 Next Action
- ⏩ **Implement autoheal_daemon.cjs prototype**
- ⏩ **Enable LaunchAgent for monitoring**
- ⏩ **Deploy governance dashboard stub in Ops UI**
