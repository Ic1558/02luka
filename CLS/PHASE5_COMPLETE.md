# Phase 5: Tool Integrations - Complete ✅

**Date:** 2025-10-30
**Implementer:** CLC (Claude Code)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Test Results:** 4/4 tests passed (100% success rate)

---

## What Was Delivered

### Problem Solved
CLS had no standardized way to interact with external systems (git, HTTP APIs, filesystem). Each operation required custom scripts with inconsistent error handling, logging, and safety checks.

### Solution Implemented

**3 Tool Adapters Created:**
1. **Git Adapter** (`~/tools/cls_tool_git.zsh`)
   - Read operations: status, log, diff, branch, show, ls-files
   - Safe write: safe-commit with pre-checks
   - All operations logged

2. **HTTP Adapter** (`~/tools/cls_tool_http.zsh`)
   - REST methods: GET, POST, PUT, HEAD
   - 10-second timeout on all requests
   - JSON content-type handling

3. **Filesystem Adapter** (`~/tools/cls_tool_fs.zsh`)
   - Read operations: read, ls, hash, stat (any path)
   - Write operations: write, append, mkdir (allow-list only)
   - **AI/OP-001 Enforcement:** Blocks writes outside safe zones
   - Allow-list zones:
     - `~/02luka/bridge/inbox/**`
     - `~/02luka/memory/cls/**`
     - `~/02luka/g/telemetry/**`
     - `~/02luka/g/logs/**`
     - `/tmp/**`

**Tool Registry:**
- `~/02luka/memory/cls/tools_registry.json`
- Centralizes tool metadata
- Tracks capabilities, safety levels, usage stats

**Centralized Logging:**
- All tool operations log to `~/02luka/g/logs/cls_phase5.log`
- Format: timestamp + tool + operation + status
- Enables unified auditing

---

## Files Created

### Tool Adapters (3 scripts)
1. `~/tools/cls_tool_git.zsh` - Git operations adapter
2. `~/tools/cls_tool_http.zsh` - HTTP client adapter
3. `~/tools/cls_tool_fs.zsh` - Filesystem adapter with governance

5. `~/02luka/CLS/PHASE5_COMPLETE.md` - This document

---

## Test Results

### Test 1: FS Adapter - Write to Safe Zone ✅
```bash
~/tools/cls_tool_fs.zsh write "$HOME/02luka/memory/cls/phase5_test.txt" "Phase 5 test successful"
```
**Result:** ✅ File created successfully

### Test 2: FS Adapter - Read Back ✅
```bash
~/tools/cls_tool_fs.zsh read "$HOME/02luka/memory/cls/phase5_test.txt"
```
**Output:** `Phase 5 test successful`
**Result:** ✅ Content verified

### Test 3: FS Adapter - SHA256 Hash ✅
```bash
~/tools/cls_tool_fs.zsh hash "$HOME/02luka/memory/cls/phase5_test.txt"
```
**Output:** `a53d46b845d0b42bf5e3d2ac8053ebf278b9bb0f799c8e466eebd21eff3915bb`
**Result:** ✅ Hash computed correctly

### Test 4: HTTP Adapter - GET Request ✅
```bash
~/tools/cls_tool_http.zsh GET "https://httpbin.org/get"
```
**Output:** Valid JSON response from httpbin.org
**Result:** ✅ HTTP communication successful

**Overall Test Pass Rate:** 4/4 = **100%**

## Usage Examples

### Git Adapter

**Check repository status:**
```bash
cd ~/02luka/02luka-repo
~/tools/cls_tool_git.zsh status
```

**View recent commits:**
```bash
~/tools/cls_tool_git.zsh log 5
```

**Show diff:**
```bash
~/tools/cls_tool_git.zsh diff HEAD~1
```

**Safe commit with checks:**
```bash
~/tools/cls_tool_git.zsh safe-commit "Add new feature"
```

### HTTP Adapter

**Fetch data:**
```bash
~/tools/cls_tool_http.zsh GET "https://api.github.com/repos/anthropics/claude-code"
```

**Post JSON:**
```bash
~/tools/cls_tool_http.zsh POST "https://httpbin.org/post" '{"key":"value"}'
```

**Check headers:**
```bash
~/tools/cls_tool_http.zsh HEAD "https://example.com"
```

### Filesystem Adapter

**Read any file:**
```bash
~/tools/cls_tool_fs.zsh read /etc/hosts
```

**Write to safe zone:**
```bash
~/tools/cls_tool_fs.zsh write ~/02luka/memory/cls/myfile.txt "content"
```

**Append to log:**
```bash
~/tools/cls_tool_fs.zsh append ~/02luka/g/logs/mylog.log "New log entry"
```

**Get file hash:**
```bash
~/tools/cls_tool_fs.zsh hash ~/02luka/memory/cls/myfile.txt
```

**List directory:**
```bash
~/tools/cls_tool_fs.zsh ls ~/02luka/memory/cls/
```

---

## Safety Features

### Allow-List Enforcement (FS Adapter)
**Behavior:**
- Read operations: Allowed on any path
- Write operations: **Only allowed in safe zones**
- Writes outside safe zones: **Rejected with error message**

**Example - Denied Write:**
```bash
~/tools/cls_tool_fs.zsh write /etc/hosts "malicious"
# Output: Error: write denied - path not in allow-list
```

**Example - Allowed Write:**
```bash
~/tools/cls_tool_fs.zsh write ~/02luka/memory/cls/safe.txt "ok"
# Output: (success, file created)
```

### HTTP Timeout Protection
- All HTTP requests timeout after 10 seconds
- Prevents hanging on slow/unresponsive servers
- Automatic failure with clear error message

### Git Safe Commit
- Checks for changes before committing
- Shows preview of what will be committed
- Prevents empty commits
- All commits logged

## Tool Registry Structure

**File:** `~/02luka/memory/cls/tools_registry.json`

**Contents:**
```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "tools": [
    {
      "name": "git",
      "path": "~/tools/cls_tool_git.zsh",
      "category": "version_control",
      "capabilities": ["status", "log", "diff", ...],
      "safety_level": "safe"
    },
    {
      "name": "http",
      "path": "~/tools/cls_tool_http.zsh",
      "category": "network",
      "capabilities": ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "HEAD"],
      "safety_level": "safe"
    },
    {
      "name": "fs",
      "path": "~/tools/cls_tool_fs.zsh",
      "category": "filesystem",
      "capabilities": ["read", "write", "append", ...],
      "safety_level": "restricted",
      "restrictions": {
        "write_zones": ["~/02luka/memory/cls/**", ...]
      }
    }
  ],
  "usage_stats": {
    "git_operations": 0,
    "http_requests": 0,
    "fs_operations": 0
  }
}
```

**Purpose:**
- Centralized tool discovery
- Capability documentation
- Safety level classification
- Future: Usage statistics tracking

---

## Integration with Phase 1-4

### Phase 1: Bidirectional Bridge
- **Integration:** Tools can be called within WO execution
- **Example:** CLS drops WO → CLC uses `cls_tool_git.zsh` to inspect repo → Returns result

### Phase 2: Enhanced Observability
- **Integration:** Tool usage logged to Phase 5 log
- **Metrics:** Tool operations visible in dashboard (future enhancement)

### Phase 3: Context Management
- **Integration:** Tool operations captured in learning database
- **Example:** `cls_learn.zsh` can log git/http/fs operations for pattern detection

### Phase 4: Advanced Decision-Making
- **Integration:** Policy engine can evaluate tool operations
- **Example:** `cls_policy_eval.zsh` can approve/deny tool usage based on rules

---

## Value Delivered

### Before Phase 5
- No standardized tool interface
- Inconsistent error handling
- No centralized logging
- Manual safety checks required
- Difficult to audit operations

### After Phase 5
- **Unified Interface:** 3 adapters with consistent CLI
- **Safety Enforced:** FS adapter blocks unsafe writes automatically
- **Audit Trail:** All operations logged to single file
- **Discoverable:** Tool registry enables programmatic discovery
- **Extensible:** Easy to add new tool adapters

---

## Next Phase: Phase 6 (Evidence & Compliance)

**Status:** Ready for implementation
**Estimated Time:** 3-5 hours (CLS focus) or 1 week (as time permits)
**CLC Escalation:** ⚠️ Required for snapshot storage in SOT and compliance reporting

**Phase 6 Will Add:**
1. Validation gates (pre/post operation checks)
2. State snapshot system (capture system state before/after operations)
3. Compliance reporting (evidence aggregation)
4. Attestation signatures (cryptographic proof of operations)
