## Analysis

All four conflicting branches are variants of the same feature (user authentication) and modify the same files:
1. **boss-api/server.cjs** - Main API server file
2. **scripts/smoke.sh** - Smoke test script

The conflicts likely stem from:
- Changes made to `boss-api/server.cjs` in the main branch since these branches diverged
- Possible structural changes to the server architecture
- Updates to the smoke test scripts

## Recommendations

1. **Consolidate branches:** All four branches appear to be attempts at the same feature. Consider:
   - Picking the most recent/complete version
   - Closing/deleting the other variants

2. **Resolve conflicts:** To resolve conflicts in the chosen branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout codex/add-user-authentication-feature
   git merge origin/main
   # Resolve conflicts in boss-api/server.cjs and scripts/smoke.sh
   git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts with main"
   ```

3. **Review changes:** Before merging, review:
   - Recent changes to `boss-api/server.cjs` in main
   - The authentication implementation approach
   - Whether tests still pass after conflict resolution

## Clean Branches (No Conflicts)

All other 189 branches can be merged into main without conflicts. Notable clean branches include:
- All other `codex/*` feature branches
- All `chore/*` maintenance branches
- All `fix/*` bug fix branches
- All `feat/*` feature branches
