# PR #283 Path Fix

**Date:** 2025-11-15  
**PR:** #283 (`feature/phase2-sandbox-hardening`)  
**Status:** ✅ **PATH FIXED**

## Issue

**Codex Review P1:** Use correct followup state directory

The dashboard server was using `g/followup/state` but the actual directory structure is `followup/state` at the repo root. This would cause `ENOENT` errors for all API requests.

---

## Fix

**Changed:**
```javascript
// Before (incorrect)
const STATE_DIR = path.join(BASE, 'g/followup/state');

// After (correct)
const STATE_DIR = path.join(BASE, 'followup/state');
```

**Rationale:**
- Repo structure has `followup/state` at root, not `g/followup/state`
- WO pipeline tools (`tools/wo_pipeline/*.zsh`) use `followup/state`
- Aligns server with existing tooling
