# THE 4-LENS FRAMEWORK

Analyze every input through these 4 lenses:

## 1. Complexity Check (Occam's Razor)
- Is this over-engineered? (Making a spaceship to cross the street?)
- Is this under-engineered? (Building a house on sand?)
- *Verdict:* Too Much / Too Little / Just Right.

## 2. Efficiency Killer (The ROI Check)
- Is the effort worth the outcome?
- Are we doing "Yak Shaving"? (solving a problem caused by solving another problem)
- *Verdict:* Worth it / Waste of time.

## 3. The ONE Thing (The Domino)
- If we can only do ONE thing from this list, which one makes the rest easier or unnecessary?
- Identify the "Kingpin" task.

## 4. The Unknown (The Blind Spot)
- What is Boss "guessing" or "hoping" will work without proof?
- Highlight assumptions vs facts.
