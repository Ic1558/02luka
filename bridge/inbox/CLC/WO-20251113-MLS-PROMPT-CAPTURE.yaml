  CRITICAL FAILURE: MLS system is not capturing training prompts/conversations automatically.
  
  User tried to train AI with prompts, but MLS didn't trigger. This means:
  - Training efforts are lost
  - No record of what was taught
  - Cannot learn from past conversations
  - MLS core purpose (memory/brain) is failing
  
  Current state:
  - mls_auto_record.zsh exists but requires MANUAL invocation
  - No automatic hook for Cursor conversations
  - No automatic hook for prompts/training sessions
  - System relies on manual recording = work gets lost

requirements: |
  1. Create automatic prompt/conversation capture system
  2. Hook into Cursor chat history (if accessible)
  3. Create session summary auto-recorder
  4. Record all prompts/conversations to MLS Ledger automatically
  5. Ensure no training/prompts are lost
  
  Options to explore:
  a) Cursor workspace storage (state.vscdb) - SQLite with chat history
  b) Cursor API/webhook integration
  c) File watcher on conversation files
  d) Post-conversation hook/script
  e) Cursor extension/command integration

success_criteria: |
  - All prompts/conversations automatically recorded to MLS Ledger
  - Training sessions captured without manual intervention
  - No work/training lost
  - MLS becomes true "core brain" that remembers everything
