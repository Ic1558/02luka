  "objective": "Bring system/reports into the LAC pipeline as a first-class project, mirroring the Antigravity pattern: 1) treat system/reports as the real project root, 2) create (or verify) a clean symlink g/src/reports -> system/reports, 3) add a minimal LAC-oriented README under system/reports/, 4) add a minimal pytest smoke test under system/reports/tests/ that only asserts the project layout (no business logic), and 5) keep all changes policy-compliant via shared.policy (no touching other projects).",
