# ü™ù Memory Hooks Setup Guide

**Purpose:** Automate memory recording for significant commits and events

---

## Post-Commit Hook (Automatic Memory Recording)

### What It Does

Automatically records significant commits to the vector memory system:
- **Feat commits** ‚Üí Recorded as `plan` memories
- **Fix commits** ‚Üí Recorded as `solution` memories
- **Perf/optimize commits** ‚Üí Recorded as `insight` memories

**Criteria for Recording:**
- ‚úÖ Commit affects ‚â•3 files (skip trivial changes)
- ‚úÖ Commit message follows conventional format (`feat:`, `fix:`, etc.)
- ‚ùå Skip: docs-only, style, chore, minor refactors

### Installation

**Option 1: Symbolic Link (Recommended)**
```bash
cd /path/to/02luka-repo
ln -sf ../../scripts/post-commit-memory-hook.sh .git/hooks/post-commit
```

**Option 2: Copy Hook**
```bash
cd /path/to/02luka-repo
cp scripts/post-commit-memory-hook.sh .git/hooks/post-commit
chmod +x .git/hooks/post-commit
```

**Verify Installation:**
```bash
ls -la .git/hooks/post-commit
# Should show: post-commit -> ../../scripts/post-commit-memory-hook.sh
```

### Testing

**Test 1: Make a significant commit**
```bash
# Create test changes (3+ files)
touch test1.txt test2.txt test3.txt
git add test1.txt test2.txt test3.txt
git commit -m "feat: test automatic memory recording"

# Check memory
node memory/index.cjs --stats
# Should show: totalMemories increased by 1

# View the recorded memory
node memory/index.cjs --recall "test automatic memory"
# Should return: the commit we just made
```

**Test 2: Verify skipped commits**
```bash
# Docs-only commit (should be skipped)
echo "test" > README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "docs: update readme"

# Check memory (should NOT increase)
node memory/index.cjs --stats
```

### Customization

**Adjust Significance Threshold:**

Edit `scripts/post-commit-memory-hook.sh`:
```bash
# Change from 3 to your preferred minimum
if [ "$COMMIT_FILES" -lt 5 ]; then  # Now requires 5+ files
  exit 0
fi
```

**Add Custom Skip Patterns:**
```bash
# Skip additional patterns
if echo "$COMMIT_MSG" | grep -qE "^(test:|ci:|build:)"; then
  exit 0
fi
```

**Add Custom Memory Kinds:**
```bash
# Add more specific categorization
elif echo "$COMMIT_MSG" | grep -qE "^refactor:"; then
  KIND="insight"  # Refactors often provide insights
elif echo "$COMMIT_MSG" | grep -qE "^test:"; then
  KIND="solution"  # Tests often solve validation problems
fi
```

### Troubleshooting

**Hook not running:**
```bash
# Check if hook is executable
ls -la .git/hooks/post-commit

# Make it executable if needed
chmod +x .git/hooks/post-commit

# Check if symlink is correct
readlink .git/hooks/post-commit
# Should show: ../../scripts/post-commit-memory-hook.sh
```

**Hook runs but no memory recorded:**
```bash
# Check if memory module exists
ls -la memory/index.cjs

# Check if node is available
which node

# Manually test memory recording
node memory/index.cjs --remember plan "Test manual recording"

# Check git commit message format
git log -1 --pretty=%B
# Should start with: feat:, fix:, etc.
```

**Too many memories being recorded:**
```bash
# Increase file threshold (edit hook script)
# Or add more skip patterns
```

### Uninstallation

```bash
cd /path/to/02luka-repo
rm .git/hooks/post-commit
```

## Other Hooks (Future Enhancements)

### Pre-Push Hook (Validate Before Push)

**Planned Features:**
- Check memory consistency before push
- Validate recent commits have memory entries
- Suggest recording if significant work not captured

**Status:** Planned for Phase 6.5

### Post-Merge Hook (Record Merges)

**Planned Features:**
- Record successful merges as insights
- Track integration patterns
- Note conflict resolutions

**Status:** Planned for Phase 6.5

---

## Best Practices

**DO:**
- ‚úÖ Use conventional commit messages (`feat:`, `fix:`, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Make meaningful commits (not "WIP" or "temp")
- ‚úÖ Review memory periodically: `node memory/index.cjs --stats`
- ‚úÖ Clean up memory occasionally: `node memory/index.cjs --clear` (with backup)

**DON'T:**
- ‚ùå Commit secrets/tokens (they'll be recorded in memory)
- ‚ùå Make tiny commits just to trigger recording
- ‚ùå Rely solely on auto-recording (manual recording still valuable)

---

## Integration with Workflow

### Standard Workflow
```bash
# 1. Make changes
vim memory/index.cjs

# 2. Test changes
node memory/index.cjs --stats

# 3. Commit (hook auto-records if significant)
git add memory/index.cjs
git commit -m "feat: add importance scoring to memory system"

# 4. Verify recording (optional)
node memory/index.cjs --recall "importance scoring"

# 5. Push to remote
git push
```

### Manual Override

If you want to record something the hook skipped:
```bash
# After commit
node memory/index.cjs --remember solution \
  "Detailed explanation of what was done and why"
```

---

## Metrics

**Tracking Hook Effectiveness:**
```bash
# Check memory growth over time
node memory/index.cjs --stats

# Review recent auto-recorded memories
node memory/index.cjs --recall "Commit" | head -20

# Identify patterns
git log --oneline --since="1 week ago" | wc -l  # Total commits
# Compare to:
node memory/index.cjs --stats  # Total memories
# Ratio should be ~30-50% (not all commits should be recorded)
```
