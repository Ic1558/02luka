# Google Drive Mirror → Stream Migration (Oct 2025)
- Mirror: local copies; Stream: cloud-on-demand → CloudStorage paths unsafe for LaunchAgents.
- Duplicates archived to: `~/02luka/archive/local_drive_legacy/`
- Folders like `c/centralized/*`, `c/reports/*` in archive are migration artifacts, **do not restore**.
Decision: Keep repo as the single source of truth; do not restore archive contents.
