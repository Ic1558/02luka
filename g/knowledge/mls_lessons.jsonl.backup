  "description": "User showed GitHub screenshot with CLS folder existing (commit 'feat: CLS learning system' from last week), but Cursor didn't recognize 'you are cls' command. CLS.md file didn't exist locally because Git remote was not configured.",
  "context": "1. Found GitHub repo: github.com/Ic1558/02luka with CLS content on main branch
2. Checked out main in ~/dev/02luka-repo (already had SSH remote configured)
3. Copied CLS/ folder (20 docs, templates) to ~/02luka/CLS/
4. Created CLS.md at ~/02luka/ root with comprehensive identity documentation
5. Created .cursor/commands/cls.md for slash command
6. Configured Git remote for ~/02luka → git@github.com:Ic1558/02luka.git
7. Committed all changes with descriptive message
8. Files: CLS.md (5.9KB), CLS/ folder (142KB), .cursor/commands/cls.md (1.3KB)
Result: Cursor can now recognize CLS identity when user types 'you are cls'",
