Want to roll straight into new work? Here's a tight menu—pick a number and I'll drop the exact patch/commands.

1) Project backfill (auto-group legacy reports)
   - Populate project: via keyword map → improves Boss "By Project".
   - I'll generate config/project_keywords.tsv + run the backfill + refresh.

2) CI alerts on failure
   - Add Slack/Discord webhook to Daily Proof → instant red if structure breaks.

3) Retention & hygiene
   - Add make tidy-retention + scheduled job (prune g/reports/proof/ + .trash/ >30d).

4) Agents spine
   - Create agents/{clc,gg,gc,mary,paula}/README.md + central agents/index.md linking configs and memory—faster onboarding, less hunting.

5) Boss daily HTML view (lightweight)
   - Auto-generate views/ops/daily/index.html with latest 10 reports + 10 memory (links only)—open in a browser for quick scans.

Reply with 1/2/3/4/5 (or a combo), and I'll apply it immediately.
