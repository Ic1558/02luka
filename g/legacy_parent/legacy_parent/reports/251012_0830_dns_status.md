# DNS Status Update

**Date:** 2025-10-12 08:30
**Status:** Manual action required

## Current State

### ✅ Working
- **Pages deployment:** https://theedges-dashboard.pages.dev
  - Serving: "02LUKA UI" ✅
  - Build: boss-ui/dist/
  - Status: Fully operational

- **Backend API:** http://127.0.0.1:4000
  - 7 endpoints operational
  - /api/smoke health checks passing

- **Git repository:**
  - All changes committed and pushed (commit 7a7475c)
  - Tracking documentation complete

### ❌ Blocked
- **Custom domain:** https://dashboard.theedges.work
  - Currently serving: n8n interface ❌
  - Expected: Boss-UI dashboard
  - Root cause: Old tunnel CNAME record still active

## Manual Action Required

### Remove Old Tunnel DNS Record

**Location:** Cloudflare Dashboard → DNS Records

**Steps:**
1. Go to: https://dash.cloudflare.com
2. Select domain: theedges.work
3. Navigate: DNS → Records
4. Find record:
   - Type: CNAME
   - Name: dashboard
   - Target: 8c87acc7.cfargotunnel.com (or similar tunnel ID)
5. Click "Edit" or "Delete"
6. Confirm deletion

**Verification:**
```bash
# After deletion, check if Boss-UI is served
curl -sL https://dashboard.theedges.work | grep "02LUKA UI"
# Should return: "02LUKA UI" (not "n8n.io")
```

**Alternative:** Wait for Pages domain verification to complete automatically (may take longer)

## Technical Details

### Why Manual Action?
- CLI authentication failed (token issues with Cloudflare API)
- cloudflared CLI doesn't have DNS record deletion command
- Wrangler uses OAuth which doesn't expose tokens for raw API calls
- Safest: Direct UI access to delete specific DNS record

### Current DNS Configuration
- `dashboard.theedges.work` → Old tunnel CNAME (priority: high, serving n8n)
- `dashboard.theedges.work` → Pages custom domain (pending verification)
- `n8n.theedges.work` → New tunnel route (DNS propagating)

### Expected After Fix
- `dashboard.theedges.work` → Boss-UI (via Pages)
- `n8n.theedges.work` → n8n interface (via Tunnel)

## Timeline

**Completed (7+ hours ago):**
- Dashboard deployment to Pages
- Custom domain added to Pages project
- Tunnel configuration updated
- Backend API implementation
- Documentation and reports

**Current (now):**
- Pages deployment: ✅ Working
- Custom domain: ⏳ Awaiting manual DNS cleanup
- Tracking system: ✅ Restored

**Next (after DNS cleanup):**
- Custom domain: ✅ Will serve Boss-UI
- n8n subdomain: ✅ Will serve n8n
- System: 100% operational
