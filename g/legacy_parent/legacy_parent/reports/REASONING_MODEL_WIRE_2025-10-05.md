# Reasoning Model Wire Report (2025-10-05)

## Overview
CLC reasoning model successfully exported and wired into Cursor hybrid memory system.

## Deliverables
- **Export File:** a/section/clc/logic/REASONING_MODEL_EXPORT.yaml
- **Hybrid Memory:** .codex/hybrid_memory_system.md (reasoning_model.import added)
- **Wire Mode:** mirror (bi-directional sync)

## Validation Results
- **Preflight:** ✅ OK
- **Smoke Tests:** ✅ OK
- **CLC Gate:** ✅ Passed

## Reasoning Model Specs
- **Version:** 1.0
- **Owner:** CLC
- **Scope:** code-gen, orchestration, verification
- **Compatibility:** cursor.hybrid_memory.v1, codex.guardrails.v1

## Key Features
- **Principles:** Clarity over cleverness, Safety first, Short context
- **Pipeline:** 7-step default reasoning (observe → plan → act → verify)
- **Controls:** Max 2 recursion, 4 context pages, 500 diff lines
- **Validation:** Preflight + mapping guard + smoke tests
- **Safety:** Deny GDrive paths, prefer dev repo paths

## Integration Status
✅ File created and validated
✅ Wired into Cursor hybrid memory
✅ Git checkpoint created (commit 611f019)
✅ Pushed to remote successfully

## Next Steps
- Cursor AI will import reasoning model on next session
- Both CLC and Cursor will follow same reasoning patterns
- Updates to YAML will auto-sync via hybrid memory bridge
