  mode: mirror

## Core Components

### 1. User Profile System
```yaml
# .codex/user_profile.yml
user:
  name: "Boss"
  preferences:
    language: "thai_english_mixed"
    detail_level: "high"
    confirmation_required: true
    working_style: "systematic"
    testing_approach: "comprehensive"
    documentation: "detailed"
  
  communication_style:
    - thai_english_mixed: 85%
    - detailed_explanations: 90%
    - confirmation_required: 95%
    - step_by_step: 88%
  
  working_patterns:
    - systematic_approach: 88%
    - testing_before_commit: 92%
    - step_by_step: 87%
    - comprehensive_documentation: 89%
```

### 2. Behavioral Learning System
```python
# .codex/behavioral_learning.py
class BehavioralLearning:
    def __init__(self):
        self.interaction_patterns = {}
        self.user_preferences = {}
        self.working_style = {}
    
    def analyze_interaction(self, interaction):
        """Analyze user interaction patterns"""
        # Learn from user's communication style
        # Learn from user's working approach
        # Learn from user's problem-solving methods
        pass
    
    def predict_user_needs(self, context):
        """Predict what user needs based on patterns"""
        # Predict communication style
        # Predict working approach
        # Predict problem-solving method
        pass
    
    def adapt_style(self, context):
        """Adapt AI style to user preferences"""
        # Adjust communication style
        # Adjust working approach
        # Adjust problem-solving method
        pass
```

### 3. Smart Context Loading
```markdown
# .codex/smart_context.md
## Auto-Learning System

### User Learning
- Analyzes interaction patterns
- Learns user preferences
- Adapts communication style
- Predicts user needs

### Project Learning
- Tracks project evolution
- Learns development patterns
- Adapts to project needs
- Predicts next steps

### Context Awareness
- Loads relevant context automatically
- Maintains conversation continuity
- Adapts to current situation
- Provides personalized responses
```

### 4. Memory Persistence
```yaml
# .codex/memory_persistence.yml
persistent_memory:
  user_profile:
    file: ".codex/user_profile.yml"
    auto_update: true
    learning_rate: 0.1
  
  interaction_history:
    file: ".codex/interaction_history.json"
    max_entries: 1000
    auto_cleanup: true
  
  project_context:
    file: "run/status/current_work.json"
    auto_update: true
    sync_with_git: true
  
  learning_patterns:
    file: ".codex/learning_patterns.json"
    auto_update: true
    adaptive_learning: true
```

### 5. CLC ↔ Cursor Coordination (MCP + Task Bus)

**Status:** ✅ Auto-start enabled (both components start on login)

```yaml
# Real-time coordination system
coordination:
  mcp_fs_server:
    purpose: "Cursor reads 02luka files via MCP tools"
    port: 8765
    transport: "SSE"
    tools:
      - read_text(relpath)    # Read files from SOT
      - list_dir(relpath)     # List directory contents
      - file_info(relpath)    # Get file metadata
    health: "http://127.0.0.1:8765/health"
    auto_start: true

  task_bus_bridge:
    purpose: "Share task events between CLC and Cursor"
    channel: "mcp:tasks"
    storage: "a/memory/active_tasks.{json,jsonl}"
    publish: "g/tools/emit_task_event.sh"
    auto_start: true

  coordination_pattern:
    - "CLC publishes: bash g/tools/emit_task_event.sh clc action status context"
    - "Event syncs to: a/memory/active_tasks.json (via Redis + file bridge)"
    - "Cursor reads: read_text('a/memory/active_tasks.json') via MCP"
    - "Cursor publishes: same emit_task_event.sh script"
    - "CLC sees events: tail a/memory/active_tasks.jsonl or read JSON snapshot"
```

**Quick Usage for Cursor:**
```python
# Read latest tasks from CLC
tasks = read_text('a/memory/active_tasks.json')

# List files in a directory
files = list_dir('g/tools')

# Get file metadata
info = file_info('02luka.md')
```

**Documentation:** See `AUTOSTART_CONFIG.md`, `TASK_BUS_SYSTEM.md`
