# Codex Golden Prompt

Use this expanded template when you need exhaustive context capture, deep validation criteria, or multi-phase delegation. Mirror the structure from `master_prompt.md`, but enrich each section with scenario-specific details and checkpoints.

> Reminder: Update g/tools/install_master_prompt.sh if you change this file so the installer stays authoritative.
