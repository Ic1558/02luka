# Opal R&D Node Integration

- Add R&D node after CLS/QA in Opal workflows to auto-generate lessons/rules and push updates to memory.
- Ensure CLS lane emits background analytics (pass/fail/reasoning depth, escalation signals) for the R&D node to consume.
- Send digest reports to Mary and GG summarizing R&D proposals and open risks.
