# R&D Governance Rules

- Every WO summary passes through the R&D node after QA to log lessons and risk flags before closure.
- If a WO fails or uses only basic reasoning, open an improvement ticket in `g/memory/improvement_tickets/` and notify Architect/Senior.
- Architect planning nodes must ingest `g/memory/latest_lessons.json` and `g/memory/latest_rules.json` on each cycle.
