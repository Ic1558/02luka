# Debug/Optimize/Block Status Recap

- Created: 2025-10-14T21:06:15+00:00

## Latest Debug Findings

- The Phase 3 cleanup report highlights that stub-based LaunchAgent wrappers caused repeated `exit=1` failures that were harder to debug than missing scripts, so the remediation path disables the stubs and documents the decisions instead of chasing phantom binaries.【F:g/reports/P3_FINAL_CLEANUP_251007_0456.md†L211-L221】
- The earlier LaunchAgent diagnosis confirmed six chronically failing agents were intentionally disabled, and notes that the complex `health_proxy` wrapper remains the only area that would need deeper debugging if re-enabled later.【F:g/reports/LAUNCHAGENT_DIAGNOSIS_COMPLETE.md†L82-L119】

## Optimize Path Status

- The delegation system map routes `model_router.sh optimize` requests to the local llama3.1 profile for refinement work, positioning it as the preferred optimizer with zero API cost and clear trade-offs on context and hardware expectations.【F:g/reports/DELEGATION_SYSTEM_MAP_251007_2200.md†L140-L170】
- Earlier priority fixes already verified the `/api/optimize` endpoint in the boss API smoke checklist, so the optimizer plumbing remains validated prior to this summary.【F:g/reports/PRIORITY_FIXES_251005_042000.md†L180-L188】

## Blocking Items Review

- The most recent Cloudflare gateway environment setup report states that all infrastructure prerequisites are complete and explicitly lists “Blocking Items: None,” leaving only codex-side integrations outstanding.【F:g/reports/251013_0200_cloudflare_gateways_env_setup.md†L368-L392】
- Previous outstanding-task analysis showed Context Engineering v6.0 was blocked by a fork limit failure during Phase 1.4, giving us historical context for the resolved blocker list above.【F:g/reports/OUTSTANDING_TASKS_DASHBOARD.md†L23-L55】

## Verification Summary

- Confirmed that the latest debug, optimize, and block documents all build on earlier verifications rather than introducing new gaps.
- No additional guardrail issues surfaced while compiling this report; prior validations cover the referenced systems.
