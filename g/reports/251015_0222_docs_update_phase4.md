# Documentation Update: Phase 4 + Linear-lite UI

**Session:** 251015_0222
**Agent:** CLC
**Task:** Update documentation to reflect Phase 4 MCP Verification and Linear-lite UI integration

---

## Summary

Updated 3 core documentation files to reflect recent system enhancements:
- Phase 4: MCP Verification integration in atomic operations
- Linear-lite UI multipage serving on port 4000
- API stub mode for fast smoke testing
- Reports API endpoints

---

## Files Updated

### 1. docs/api_endpoints.md

**Changes:**
- Fixed `/api/plan` schema: `goal` field (was incorrectly documented as `prompt`)
- Added stub mode documentation:
  - Body parameter: `{"goal":"ping","stub":true}`
  - HTTP header: `X-Smoke: 1`
  - Returns instant response: `{"plan":"STUB: Plan endpoint operational","goal":"ping","mode":"smoke"}`
- Added Reports API section:
  - `GET /api/reports/list` - List recent atomic operation reports
  - `GET /api/reports/latest` - Get latest report markdown
  - `GET /api/reports/summary` - Get JSON summary from reportbot
- Added UI Routes section:
  - `GET /` - Landing page
  - `GET /chat`, `/plan`, `/build`, `/ship` - Working mode pages
  - `GET /shared/*` - Static assets (ui.css, api.js, components.js)
- Updated development tips with stub mode examples
- Updated test commands to include ops_atomic.sh

**Why:**
- Previous documentation had wrong field name (`prompt` vs `goal`)
- New stub mode feature was undocumented
- Reports API endpoints were missing from docs
- UI routing was undocumented

---

### 2. docs/02luka.md

**Changes:**
- Added section 11: "Latest Deployment (2025-10-15)"
  - Phase 4: MCP Verification Integration (4 phases total)
  - Linear-lite UI Integration (multipage serving, single-origin)
  - API Enhancements (stub mode, reports API, schema fix)
  - Smoke Testing Improvements (timeouts, fast testing)
- Updated checkpoints table:
  - Added `v251015_0212_atomic_phase4` as latest
  - Added `v251011_1845_domain_migration` entry
- Updated "Latest" tag reference to v251015_0212_atomic_phase4
- Updated last session timestamp to 251015_021237

**Why:**
- Deployment section documents major system milestone
- Checkpoint table provides version history
- Future sessions need deployment context

---

### 3. docs/CONTEXT_ENGINEERING.md

**Changes:**
- Updated system architecture diagram:
  - Changed "Luka Frontend (luka.html UI)" to "Linear-lite UI (4000)"
  - Added UI routes: /, /chat, /plan, /build, /ship
  - Added /shared/* static assets
  - Updated boss-api to show: /api/plan, /api/patch, /api/reports/*
- Updated integration checklist:
  - Added 4 new items for Linear-lite UI features
  - Marked all UI/API integrations as complete [x]
- Updated timestamp to 2025-10-15T02:12:37Z

**Why:**
- Architecture diagram was outdated (showed old UI structure)
- Integration checklist needed current feature status
- Document timestamp needed update
