# 🧠 CLS Phase 9.2-A — Auto-Heal Daemon Implementation Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-22  
**Status:** 🟢 Complete and Operational

## Core Deliverable

**File:** g/tools/services/autoheal_daemon.cjs  
**Purpose:** Autonomous process monitor + self-recovery service

## Functional Highlights

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| PID Tracking | Monitors cloudflared, bridge, redis processes with graceful restart |
| Health Endpoints | Validates Worker & Bridge via HTTP checks |
| Recovery Logic | 3 retries × 5s delay per process failure |
| Interval Loop | 30-second continuous monitoring |
| Alert System | Discord webhook with cool-down + severity levels |
| Telemetry Log | JSON events → g/telemetry/autoheal.log |

## Verification Checklist
- ✅ Health-check requests return 200 OK
- ✅ Simulated process kill → auto-restart within 15s
- ✅ Discord alerts received < 3s latency
- ✅ No duplicate restarts (3-retry guard working)

## Next Steps (Phase 9.2-B → E)
1. 🧭 **Deploy Governance Dashboard stub (/ops/governance)**
2. ⚙️ **Register LaunchAgent com.02luka.cls.autoheal.plist**
3. 📢 **Integrate Alert Bridge for Discord + Telegram**
4. 🔁 **Validate failover path (Mini PC ↔ Cloudflare Tunnel)**
5. 🧪 **Run end-to-end system test and log uptime metrics**
