# Phase 2 Reliability - Deployment Complete ✅

**Date:** 2025-10-28 04:41  
**Work Order:** WO-251029-OPS-OPTIMIZE-PHASE2  
**Status:** Successfully Deployed & Verified

---

## 🎯 Objective Achieved

Deployed **Phase 2 Reliability** features to make the system self-healing and resilient against failures.

---

## ✅ What Was Deployed

### 1. **Circuit Breaker Pattern** (run/lib/circuit_breaker.cjs)
**Purpose:** Prevent cascading failures by fast-failing when services are down

**Features:**
- ✅ Three states: CLOSED (normal), OPEN (failing), HALF_OPEN (testing recovery)
- ✅ Configurable thresholds (default: 5 failures to open)
- ✅ Automatic timeout and recovery testing (default: 60s)
- ✅ Persistent state across restarts
- ✅ Success threshold for recovery (default: 2 successes)

**Configuration:**
```javascript
new CircuitBreaker('service-name', {
  failureThreshold: 5,    // Open after 5 failures
  successThreshold: 2,    // Close after 2 successes in HALF_OPEN
  timeout: 60000          // Try recovery after 60s
});
```

**State Management:**
- Persisted to: `g/state/circuit_breakers.json`
- Tracks: state, failures, successes, next attempt time

### 2. **Auto-Healing Service** (run/auto_heal.cjs)
**Purpose:** Automatically restart failed services

**Features:**
- ✅ Monitors 3 stub services (Health Proxy, MCP Bridge, Boss API)
- ✅ Port-based health checks
- ✅ LaunchAgent restart capability
- ✅ Cooldown between heals (5 minutes)
- ✅ Rate limiting (max 3 heals per hour per service)
- ✅ Comprehensive logging

**Healing Process:**
1. Detect service down (port check fails)
2. Check if healing is allowed (cooldown + rate limit)
3. Unload LaunchAgent
4. Wait 2 seconds
5. Load LaunchAgent
6. Wait 3 seconds
7. Verify service is up
8. Log result

**Protection Mechanisms:**
- 5-minute cooldown between heal attempts
- Maximum 3 heals per hour per service
- Prevents heal storms

**Current Status:**
- LaunchAgent: `com.02luka.auto.heal`
- Schedule: Every 5 minutes (StartInterval: 300)
- Logs: `g/logs/auto_heal.log`
- State: `g/state/auto_heal_state.json`

### 3. **Structured Alerting** (run/lib/alert_manager.cjs)
**Purpose:** Smart notifications with rate limiting to prevent alert fatigue

**Alert Levels:**
```javascript
CRITICAL: {
  threshold: 3,        // Alert after 3 consecutive failures
  cooldown: 3600000,   // 1 hour between alerts
  channels: ['discord', 'log']
}
WARNING: {
  threshold: 5,
  cooldown: 7200000,   // 2 hours
  channels: ['log']
}
INFO: {
  threshold: 10,
  cooldown: 86400000,  // 24 hours
  channels: ['log']
}
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Three alert levels with different thresholds
- ✅ Configurable cooldowns prevent spam
- ✅ Multi-channel support (Discord, log, etc.)
- ✅ Persistent state across restarts
- ✅ Alert count tracking

**State Management:**
- File: `g/state/alert_state.json`
- Tracks: last sent time, level, count

### 4. **Auto-Heal LaunchAgent**
**Configuration:**
```xml
<key>StartInterval</key>
<integer>300</integer>  <!-- Every 5 minutes -->

<key>RunAtLoad</key>
<true/>  <!-- Start immediately -->
```

**Logs:**
- `g/logs/auto_heal.out.log` - Standard output
- `g/logs/auto_heal.err.log` - Errors
- `g/logs/auto_heal.log` - Detailed healing log

## 📊 Test Results

### Auto-Healing Test (Immediate)

# View recent healing activity
tail -20 g/logs/auto_heal.log

# Check healing state
cat g/state/auto_heal_state.json

# Force a healing run
node run/auto_heal.cjs
```

# View circuit breaker states
cat g/state/circuit_breakers.json

# Test circuit breaker
node -e "
  const CB = require('./run/lib/circuit_breaker.cjs');
  const cb = new CB('test');
  console.log(cb.getState());

## 🎓 Design Decisions

### 1. Why 5-Minute Healing Interval?
- **Short enough:** Catches failures quickly
- **Long enough:** Doesn't overwhelm system
- **Practical:** Balances responsiveness and resource usage

### 2. Why 3 Heals Per Hour Limit?
- **Prevents heal storms:** If failing 4+ times/hour, needs manual intervention
- **Resource protection:** Doesn't burn CPU on broken services
- **Signal:** Frequent failures indicate systemic issues

### 3. Why Persistent State?
- **Survives restarts:** Circuit breaker memory persists
- **History tracking:** Know when services last healed
- **Debugging:** Can review past behavior

### 4. Why Circuit Breaker Over Retry?
- **Faster failure:** Don't waste time on known-down services
- **Predictable:** Defined behavior in failure mode
- **Resource efficient:** Stop trying when hopeless
- **Auto-recovery:** Tests service health periodically

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

### 1. Stub Services Only
**Limitation:** Auto-healing only manages stub services  
**Impact:** Full services need separate healing logic  
**Mitigation:** Extend service list when implementing full services

### 2. Port-Based Health Checks
**Limitation:** Only checks if port is open  
**Impact:** Doesn't verify service functionality  
**Mitigation:** Future: Add HTTP health endpoint checks

### 3. No Cross-Service Dependencies
**Limitation:** Heals services independently  
**Impact:** Doesn't handle cascading dependencies  
**Mitigation:** Future: Add dependency graph

### 4. Basic Circuit Breaker
**Limitation:** Simple threshold-based logic  
**Impact:** Doesn't adapt to patterns  
**Mitigation:** Future: Add adaptive thresholds
