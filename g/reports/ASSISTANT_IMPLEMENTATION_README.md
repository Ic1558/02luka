# Assistant Implementation Summary

## What is in this PR
- Express API (`apps/assistant-api`) with health, capability, RAG, and memory endpoints.
- Offline-ready context and memory packages orchestrating Phase 6.5 vector index.
- Minimal UI (`apps/assistant-ui/public`) exposing chat, transparency trace, and feedback controls.
- Governance docs (architecture, roles, security, prompts) plus deployment guidance.
- CI workflow, smoke script, and dev server for reproducible operations.

## Run Locally
```bash
npm install
bash scripts/dev_server.sh
# visit http://localhost:4000
```

## Smoke Test
```bash
bash scripts/smoke.sh
```

## Deploy
Refer to `docs/DEPLOY.md` for Cloudflare Pages, Ops Atomic gate configuration, Pages mirror, and Vercel/Netlify steps. Ensure TLS termination and RBAC mapping before exposure.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Missing Ops Atomic secrets**: CI warns (non-main) or fails (main). Configure via GitHub Actions secrets.
- **Connector stubs**: Drive/Slack/CRM integrations are placeholders. Documented TODOs prevent accidental execution.
- **In-memory rate limits**: Suitable for dev/staging; deploy behind WAF for production scale.
- **Audit log growth**: `g/reports/memory_audit.log` may expand. Schedule cleanup as part of ops runbook.

## Next Steps
- Implement real LLM orchestration and tool execution gating.
- Wire connectors once credentials available.
- Add automated evaluations for KPI tracking (latency, accuracy, cost).
- Expand UI to display memory recall suggestions.

## Acceptance Checklist
- [ ] API boots locally and passes smoke tests.
- [ ] Ops Atomic secrets configured (if required).
- [ ] Deployment target selected and DNS/TLS plan defined.
- [ ] Incident response contacts documented.

## Runbook
1. Start API/UI with `bash scripts/dev_server.sh`.
2. Monitor `/healthz` and `/capabilities` for readiness.
3. Use `/memory/remember` to persist insights; schedule `memory.cleanup` monthly.
4. Collect feedback from UI and triage into backlog.
5. For incidents, disable rate-limited actors by revoking tokens; escalate via Slack stub until connector live.
