**Context:** LaunchAgent cleanup completed (100% system health achieved), started Context Engineering v6.0 testing

**What Was Complete:**
- ‚úÖ LaunchAgent cleanup: 97 agents audited, 100% critical health
- ‚úÖ Git commit pushed: `a56e426`
- ‚úÖ Context Engineering v6.0 basic feature testing PASSED

**What Was In Progress When Freeze Occurred:**
- ‚è≥ Testing `model_router.sh` integration
- ‚è≥ Running integration tests with context_engine.sh v6.0

**Error Details:**
```
Line 795-796:
zsh: fork failed: resource temporarily unavailable
zsh: fork failed: resource temporarily unavailable
```

**Root Cause:** System process limit exhausted during context_engine.sh testing (likely too many subprocess spawns)

- ‚ùå Test model_router.sh with context_engine.sh v6.0
- ‚ùå Verify multi-model routing integration
- ‚ùå Test real-world API call flows
- ‚ùå Validate error handling in integrated scenarios

**Phase 1.5: Backward Compatibility** (Not Started)
- ‚è≥ Test v6.0 with existing v5 consumers
- ‚è≥ Verify graceful degradation (v6 features off by default)
- ‚è≥ Confirm environment variables work as expected
- ‚è≥ Validate logging compatibility

**Phase 2: Multi-Model Routing** (Not Started)

**Phase 3: Production Deployment** (Not Started)
- ‚è≥ Create deployment documentation
- ‚è≥ Update system manuals
- ‚è≥ Create runbook for v6.0 operations
- ‚è≥ Production rollout plan

**Priority:** üî¥ **Critical** - Core context engineering system incomplete

### Session 2: clc_251002.txt (Oct 2, 2025)

**Context:** Context Engineering v6.0 upgrade work, environment-based feature flags implementation

**What Was Complete:**
- ‚úÖ Version bump: context_engine.sh 1.0 ‚Üí 6.0
- ‚úÖ Environment flags added: AUTO_PRUNE, ADVANCED_FEATURES, V6_LOGGING, MULTI_MODEL_ROUTING
- ‚úÖ Enhanced logging with session tracking

- ‚úÖ Backward compatibility layer

**What Was In Progress:**
- ‚è≥ Phase 1.1-1.3: Core v6.0 features (appears complete)
- ‚è≥ Phase 1.4-3.0: Testing and deployment (pending)

**Error Details:**
No crash error logged in this file - appears to be continuation work

**Outstanding Tasks:**
Same as Session 1 (Phases 1.4, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0) - this session shows the upgrade work that session 251003 was trying to test

**Priority:** üü° **High** - Context for session 251003, provides implementation details

---

### Session 3: clc_250928.txt (Sept 28, 2025)

**Context:** Docker stability improvements, CORS fixes, verify_system.sh hardening

**What Was Complete:**
- ‚úÖ MCP filesystem server path fix (mcp_fs:6 updated to correct SOT path)

**Error Details:**
```
Error: ENOSPC: no space left on device, write
    at Object.writeFileSync (node:fs:2415:20)
    at Module.appendFileSync (node:fs:2497:6)

Disk Status:
/System/Volumes/Data: 100% capacity (878GB used)
Multiple Time Machine backups consuming space
```

**Root Cause:** System disk full - Claude Code unable to write session history

**Outstanding Tasks:**

**Docker Stability (Partially Implemented)**
- ‚è≥ Complete verify_system.sh Docker timeout protection
- ‚è≥ Deploy timeout wrapper function (`d()` command)
- ‚è≥ Add DOCKER_STATE checking logic
- ‚è≥ Test timeout protection with 5s limits
- ‚è≥ Add retry logic (DOCKER_RETRIES=2)

**Service Restarts (Ready but Not Executed)**
- ‚è≥ Restart health_proxy LaunchAgent to apply CORS changes
- ‚è≥ Update mcp_gateway_agent healthcheck settings
- ‚è≥ Verify CORS preflight working after restart

**System Cleanup (User Action Required)**
- ‚è≥ **Disk space cleanup** - System at 100% capacity
- ‚è≥ Clean /tmp directory
- ‚è≥ Clean ~/Library/Caches/
- ‚è≥ Review Time Machine backup retention
- ‚è≥ Remove old node_modules directories in Google Drive

**Priority:** üü¢ **Medium** - Infrastructure hardening, not blocking core functionality

## üî¨ Root Cause Analysis

### Process Limit Exhaustion (Session 251003)

**Symptoms:**
- Fork failures during context_engine.sh testing
- Likely during model_router.sh subprocess spawning

**Hypothesis:**
Context Engine v6.0 may spawn too many parallel subprocesses when testing multi-model routing

**Investigation Needed:**
```bash
# Check current limits
ulimit -a

# Monitor process count during testing
watch -n 1 'ps aux | wc -l'

# Test with reduced parallelism
MAX_PARALLEL_REQUESTS=1 bash g/tools/context_engine.sh version
```

**Mitigation:**
- Add subprocess pool limits to context_engine.sh
- Implement queue-based execution (not fork-bomb pattern)
- Add cleanup of zombie processes

### Disk Space Exhaustion (Session 250928)

**Symptoms:**
- ENOSPC errors writing to filesystem
- System partition at 100% capacity

**Root Causes:**
- Multiple Time Machine snapshots (15+ backups totaling ~10TB)
- Google Drive mirror consuming system space
- Claude Code session history files accumulating

**Immediate Actions:**
```bash
# Check disk usage
du -sh ~/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-*/
du -sh ~/Library/Caches/
du -sh /tmp/*

# Safe cleanup
rm -rf /tmp/*
rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/com.anthropic.claude-code/*
```

## üìä Impact Assessment

### Current System State

**What's Working:**
- ‚úÖ MCP auto-start deployment (completed in current session)
- ‚úÖ Task Bus Bridge operational
- ‚úÖ LaunchAgent infrastructure (100% critical health)
- ‚úÖ Basic context engineering (v5 stable)

**What's Blocked:**
- ‚ùå Context Engineering v6.0 (incomplete testing)
- ‚ùå Multi-model routing enhancements
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Docker stability improvements (90% complete, needs deployment)

**Risk Level:**
- üü° **Moderate** - System operational, but v6.0 features incomplete
- No production impact (v5 still works)
- Disk space risk for future sessions

---

## üöÄ Recommended Action Plan

### Immediate (Next Session)

**Step 1: System Health Restoration (10 minutes)**
```bash
# Free up disk space
rm -rf /tmp/*
rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/*

# Check ulimit settings
ulimit -a
ulimit -n 4096  # Increase file descriptor limit if needed
```

**Step 2: Complete Docker Timeout Protection (30 minutes)**
```bash
cd ~/dev/02luka-repo
# Apply verify_system.sh timeout wrapper patch
# Test with Docker down scenario
# Commit and deploy
```

**Step 3: Context Engineering v6.0 Testing (2-4 hours)**
```bash
# Investigate fork failure root cause
# Add subprocess limits to context_engine.sh
# Complete Phase 1.4 integration testing
# Execute Phase 1.5 backward compatibility tests
```

### Short-Term (This Week)

**Step 4: Multi-Model Routing Deployment (Phase 2)**
- Test OpenRouter integration
- Test Anthropic direct integration
- Validate routing logic

**Step 5: Production Rollout (Phase 3)**
- Create deployment documentation
- Update system manuals
- Create v6.0 operations runbook

### Medium-Term (This Month)

**Step 6: System Optimization**
- Implement subprocess pooling in context_engine.sh
- Add resource monitoring to context_performance_monitor.sh
- Create disk space monitoring LaunchAgent
