# Phase 5 Completion Report: QA Hardening

## 1. Objective
To upgrade the QA Lane from a "Mock" implementation to a "Production-Grade" gate that enforces code quality using real tools (Ruff, Flake8, Pytest) and integrates with the R&D Lane.

## 2. Execution Summary
- **Initial Plan**: "Golden Path" workflow (Plan -> QA -> Deploy).
- **Correction**: Initial implementation was too simple. Refactored (Option B) to match the Architect's robust design concept.
- **Final State**:
    - **Actions**: `QaActions` class wrapper for testability.
    - **Engine**: Dynamic checklist evaluation.
    - **Worker**: Full integration with R&D feedback loop.

## 3. Verification Results
| Test Case | Expected | Actual | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Bad File** | Fail + Issues + R&D Feedback | Failed, Issues logged, Feedback sent | ✅ PASS |
| **Good File** | Pass + Clean Checklist | Passed, Checklist all true | ✅ PASS |
| **Pattern Check** | Fail on forbidden regex | Verified via unit test logic | ✅ PASS |

## 4. Lessons Learned (Harvested)
- **"Speed without Context is Technical Debt"**: Skipping the analysis of existing components led to a sub-par initial implementation.
- **Correction**: Shifted to "Architect Mode" to align with the user's vision before finalizing code.

## 5. Next Steps
- **Phase 6**: Federation (Multi-Agent Collaboration).
- **Maintenance**: Monitor R&D insights generated by QA failures.
