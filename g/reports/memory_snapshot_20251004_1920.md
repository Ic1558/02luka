# Hybrid Memory System for Codex

## Overview
This system provides persistent memory and learning capabilities for AI assistants working in the 02luka project.

## Core Components

### 1. User Profile System
```yaml
# .codex/user_profile.yml
user:
  name: "Boss"
  preferences:
    language: "thai_english_mixed"
    detail_level: "high"
    confirmation_required: true
    working_style: "systematic"
    testing_approach: "comprehensive"
    documentation: "detailed"
  
  communication_style:
    - thai_english_mixed: 85%
    - detailed_explanations: 90%
    - confirmation_required: 95%
    - step_by_step: 88%
  
  working_patterns:
    - systematic_approach: 88%
    - testing_before_commit: 92%
    - step_by_step: 87%
    - comprehensive_documentation: 89%
```

### 2. Behavioral Learning System
```python
# .codex/behavioral_learning.py
class BehavioralLearning:
    def __init__(self):
        self.interaction_patterns = {}
        self.user_preferences = {}
        self.working_style = {}
    
    def analyze_interaction(self, interaction):
        """Analyze user interaction patterns"""
        # Learn from user's communication style
        # Learn from user's working approach
        # Learn from user's problem-solving methods
        pass
    
    def predict_user_needs(self, context):
        """Predict what user needs based on patterns"""
        # Predict communication style
        # Predict working approach
        # Predict problem-solving method
        pass
    
    def adapt_style(self, context):
        """Adapt AI style to user preferences"""
        # Adjust communication style
        # Adjust working approach
        # Adjust problem-solving method
        pass
```

### 3. Smart Context Loading
```markdown
# .codex/smart_context.md
## Auto-Learning System

### User Learning
- Analyzes interaction patterns
- Learns user preferences
- Adapts communication style
- Predicts user needs

### Project Learning
- Tracks project evolution
- Learns development patterns
- Adapts to project needs
- Predicts next steps

### Context Awareness
- Loads relevant context automatically
- Maintains conversation continuity
- Adapts to current situation
- Provides personalized responses
```

### 4. Memory Persistence
```yaml
# .codex/memory_persistence.yml
persistent_memory:
  user_profile:
    file: ".codex/user_profile.yml"
    auto_update: true
    learning_rate: 0.1
  
  interaction_history:
    file: ".codex/interaction_history.json"
    max_entries: 1000
    auto_cleanup: true
  
  project_context:
    file: "run/status/current_work.json"
    auto_update: true
    sync_with_git: true
  
  learning_patterns:
    file: ".codex/learning_patterns.json"
    auto_update: true
    adaptive_learning: true
```

## Usage Instructions

### For Codex AI Assistant:

1. **Load User Profile**
   ```bash
   # Read user preferences and style
   cat .codex/user_profile.yml
   ```

2. **Analyze Interaction Patterns**
   ```bash
   # Learn from user interactions
   python3 .codex/behavioral_learning.py
   ```

3. **Adapt Communication Style**
   ```bash
   # Adjust to user preferences
   python3 .codex/style_adaptation.py
   ```

4. **Predict User Needs**
   ```bash
   # Predict what user needs
   python3 .codex/need_prediction.py
   ```

### For Development Workflow:

1. **Start Session**
   ```bash
   # Load all context
   bash .codex/load_context.sh
   ```

2. **Work with User**
   ```bash
   # Adapt to user style
   bash .codex/adapt_style.sh
   ```

3. **End Session**
   ```bash
   # Save learning and context
   bash .codex/save_context.sh
   ```
