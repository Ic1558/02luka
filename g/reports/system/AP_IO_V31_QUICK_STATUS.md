# AP/IO v3.1 Quick Status

**Date:** 2025-11-17  
**Status:** ⏳ **CREATION IN PROGRESS**

---

## What's Done

✅ **writer.zsh** - Created with Phase 2 improvements:
- Atomic writes
- Retry logic
- Better error handling
- Test isolation support

---

## What's Next

Creating remaining 22 files. Due to the large number of files, I recommend:

**Option 1:** Create all files now (will take time)  
**Option 2:** Create essential files first (core tools + schemas), then add rest incrementally

**Essential Files Priority:**
1. Core tools (reader, validator, correlation_id)
2. Schemas
3. Basic documentation
4. Tests
5. Agent integrations

---

**Current:** 1/23 files (4%)  
**Next:** Continue with core tools
