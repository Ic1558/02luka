wo_id: WO-251107-PHASE-14-RAG-UNIFICATION
phase: 14
title: Phase 14 – SOT Unification / RAG Integration
maintainer: GG Core (02LUKA Automation)
deployed_by: CLS (Cognitive Local System Orchestrator)
verified_by: CDC / CLC / GG SOT Audit Layer
classification: Strategic Integration Patch (SIP)
status: PLANNED
timestamp: 2025-11-07T00:05:00+07:00

dependencies:
  - Phase 13.2 – Cross-Agent Binding (v1.2)
  - MCP Memory and Search servers operational
  - GG MCP bridge verified

objectives:
  - Integrate local + cloud knowledge indices into unified RAG memory
  - Establish Unified SOT Telemetry Schema across CLS/GG/CDC
  - Enable bi-directional sync between Knowledge and MCP
  - Introduce RAG-driven contextual response capability
  - Maintain audit-compliant traceability of all retrievals

deliverables:
  - tools/rag_index_federation.zsh      # index merger between local/cloud
  - config/rag_unification.yaml         # schema + source mapping
  - reports/PHASE_14_1_FEDERATION.md    # verification of memory index merge
  - reports/PHASE_14_2_TELEMETRY.md     # unified telemetry schema
  - reports/PHASE_14_3_BRIDGE_KNOWLEDGE.md
  - reports/PHASE_14_4_RAG_CONTEXT.md   # contextual retrieval validation
  - g/reports/PHASE_14_FINAL_VERIFICATION.md

success_criteria:
  - Unified RAG index accessible to all agents (GG, CDC, CLS)
  - Telemetry schema harmonized and validated
  - Verified end-to-end contextual memory retrieval across agents
  - All documentation committed with verified hashes

notes:
  - Follow Rule 93 (Evidence-Based Operations)
  - Validate all JSON/YAML artifacts via checksum
  - Keep local-first preference; cloud as secondary replication

next_phase:
  - Phase 15 – Autonomous Knowledge Routing (AKR)
