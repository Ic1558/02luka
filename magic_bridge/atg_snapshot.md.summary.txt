Okay, I've reviewed the Antigravity System Snapshot. Here's a summary:

**Overall Assessment:**

The snapshot captures a point-in-time view of the Antigravity system. It includes Git context, runtime context (processes and ports), and recent telemetry.  The git status shows there's a new file `tools/raycast_atg_snapshot.zsh`. There are ongoing modifications to `atg_snapshot.json`, `atg_snapshot.md` and associated summary files and `tools/atg_snap.zsh`. The telemetry confirms that gemini_bridge is processing these files.

**Key Observations:**

*   **New `raycast_atg_snapshot.zsh`:** This script is untracked by git which suggest it's recently added and should be added by git add.
*   **Continuous Processing:** `atg_snapshot.md` and `atg_snapshot.json` are repeatedly processed by `gemini_bridge`. Reviewing latest changes will give hint about these file changes.
*   **Port Status:** The core services seem to be functioning as expected, with `api_server` and `claude_proxy` running.
*   **Dependency on Gemini:** The logs show that `gemini_bridge` is frequently sending the generated snapshot files to Vertex AI's `gemini-2.0-flash-001` model for summarization.
*   **Fs_watcher telemetry**: The addition and removal of a debug.txt suggest someone was debugging fs_watcher.
*   **File Ingestion Deprecation Warnings**: Gemini is being called with a deprecated feature.

**Suggestions**

1.  **Track the new file:** Add `tools/raycast_atg_snapshot.zsh` to git using `git add tools/raycast_atg_snapshot.zsh`.
2.  **Investigate continuous processing:** Understand why `atg_snapshot.md` and `atg_snapshot.json` are being modified frequently, and optimize to minimize processing overhead. It may be indicative of a loop or a rapidly changing system state.
3.  **Address gemini feature deprecation warning**: Update vertex ai usage.
