The `audit_task.txt` requests a review of `magic_bridge/app_logic.py` for configuration warnings, particularly regarding imported modules.

`magic_bridge/app_logic.py` imports `secret_config`. Reviewing `secret_config.py` reveals a `TODO` comment indicating that the `TIMEOUT` variable should be changed to 60 before production. This constitutes a configuration warning, as the current value of 30 might not be suitable for a production environment.
