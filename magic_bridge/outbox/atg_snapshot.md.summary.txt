**Summary:**

*   The `atg_snapshot.md` file has been updated, along with its JSON representation and summary file.
*   A new healthcheck report `g/reports/pr11_healthcheck/2026-01-05T00:30:45.json` has been created.
*   There are modifications to `g/reports/ops/ports_check_latest.txt` and Github Actions failure logs.
*   The git diff shows a significant reduction in the size of `magic_bridge/inbox/atg_snapshot.md`, suggesting a large deletion of content.

**Potential Issues/Suggestions:**

*   Investigate the large deletion in `magic_bridge/inbox/atg_snapshot.md` to ensure it was intentional and no critical information was lost.
*   The logs show that Gemini Bridge frequently detects changes in `atg_snapshot.md`, skipping processing when the content hasn't changed. Consider optimizing the file watching mechanism to avoid unnecessary triggers.
*   The FS Daemon is constantly modifying `g/reports/ops/ports_check_latest.txt`. Monitor this file to ensure its stability and availability.
*   The Gemini Bridge logs show a deprecation warning for a Vertex AI feature expiring in June 2026. Plan for migration accordingly.
