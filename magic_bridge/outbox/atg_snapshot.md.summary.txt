OK. Here's a summary of the Antigravity System Snapshot:

**Summary:**

*   **Git:**  Several files modified (`.claude/settings.local.json`, `bridge.sh`, `gemini_bridge.py`). The last commit addresses pathing, execution and dedup issues.
*   **Runtime:** `pgrep` failed to find relevant processes, likely due to missing system monitoring setup.  `ports_check.zsh` script failing with an `UnboundLocalError`. This needs investigation.
*   **Telemetry:** `atg_runner.jsonl` shows gemini_bridge processing snapshots. There are several "file_detected" followed by "processing_start/complete" sequences. Also, the gemini bridge restarts several times.
*   **System Logs:**  stderr logs show a deprecation warning for `vertexai.generative_models`.
*   **Filesystem:** Frequent modifications to `g/reports/ops/ports_check_latest.txt` are noted.

**Potential Issues/Suggestions:**

*   Investigate the `UnboundLocalError` in `ports_check.zsh`.
*   Address the `vertexai` deprecation warning.
*   Why is the Gemini Bridge restarting? The logs show several startup events.
*   Consider setting up the recommended system monitoring setup for `pgrep` to work correctly.
*   Is `g/reports/ops/ports_check_latest.txt` expected to be modified this frequently? Investigate if this is normal behavior or indicative of an issue.
