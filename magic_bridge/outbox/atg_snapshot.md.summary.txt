**Summary:**

*   `atg_snapshot.md` updated.
*   Other modified files include `.claude/settings.local.json`, files in `magic_bridge/outbox`, and `tools/raycast_atg_snapshot.zsh`.
*   A healthcheck JSON file was created (`g/reports/pr11_healthcheck/2026-01-05T00:30:45.json`).
*   `g/reports/gh_failures` and `g/reports/gh_failures/.seen_runs` were modified.
*   The ports check report (`g/reports/ops/ports_check_latest.txt`) was updated multiple times.
*   Gemini bridge is actively processing `atg_snapshot.md`, creating summary files. It is skipping the processing of duplicate files.
*   Vertex AI deprecation warning is present in the logs.

**Potential Issues/Suggestions:**

*   Frequent modifications to `g/reports/ops/ports_check_latest.txt` might indicate a looping issue with the port check script or a service that is frequently changing its port. Investigate the cause.
*   The Vertex AI deprecation warning should be addressed, possibly by migrating to a newer API or library version before June 24, 2026.
*   The repeated detection and skipping of `atg_snapshot.md` due to unchanged content suggests a potential optimization in the fs_watcher to avoid unnecessary triggering of the Gemini bridge.
