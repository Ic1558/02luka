Okay, I will analyze the current Antigravity System Snapshot file (`atg_snapshot.md`) in the context of the provided project structure and recent filesystem activity.

Here's what I observe:

*   **File Modification:** The current file, `magic_bridge/atg_snapshot.md`, is marked as modified in the `git status` output. This is expected since this script generates it.

*   **Recent Activity:** The FS activity shows `atg_snap.zsh` (the tool that generates this snapshot) and `raycast_atg_snapshot.zsh` were recently created and modified. The `g/reports/ops/ports_check_latest.txt` file, which contains output related to open ports, is being modified frequently.

*   **Runtime Context:** The "Runtime Context" section indicates running processes, including `gemini_bridge.py`, `api_server.py`, `fs_watcher.py`, and `Antigravity.app`. `bridge.sh` which likely starts up components to sync across 2 worlds

*   **Telemetry:** The telemetry data shows the `atg_runner` lane processing `atg_snapshot.md` and generating summary files, as is expected. It seems to be capturing also `atg_snapshot.json` events. There are no errors reported in the System Logs. The FS_DAEMON telemetry also shows the creation of `tools/raycast_atg_snapshot.zsh`.

*   **Deprecation Warning:** The stderr for `bridge.sh` shows a UserWarning about a deprecated feature in `vertexai.generative_models`, set to be removed in June 2026. This is related to how gemini models are being called.

Here's a summary/review:

The Antigravity System Snapshot appears to be functioning as expected. The current snapshot captures the modified state of the `atg_snapshot.md` file. The runtime context and recent activity reveal the recent creation of `raycast_atg_snapshot.zsh`, that `atg_snap.zsh` is modified frequently and related port activities. A deprecation warning is present in the logs for the Gemini API and needs to be addressed. No immediate problems are apparent, but the vertex ai deprecation warning has to be investigated before the deadline.
