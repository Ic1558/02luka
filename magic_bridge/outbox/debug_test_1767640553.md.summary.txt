The file `debug_test_1767640553.md` was updated with a timestamped debug line. This likely indicates a debug logging activity. Recent filesystem activity shows frequent modifications to `tools/test_gemini_bridge.zsh` and its parent directory `tools`. This suggests active development or debugging related to the Gemini bridge testing. Potential issue: the frequency of modifications to the test script might indicate instability or ongoing debugging. Suggestion: Consider using a more structured logging approach and potentially implementing more robust error handling in the test script.
