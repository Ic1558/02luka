The file `manual_test_1767640170.md` was updated with a date: "Tue Jan 6 02:09:30 +07 2026". It seems like a timestamp update.

Given the recent and repeated modifications to `tools/test_gemini_bridge.zsh`, consider if the manual test update is related to those changes and if the manual test adequately covers the modified functionality in the script. Repeated modification of a script often indicates active development or debugging and a possible need to run manual tests more frequently.
