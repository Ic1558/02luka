**Summary:**

*   The file `test_bridge_1767642782.md` was updated with a timestamped test event (`2026-01-06 02:53:10`).

**Potential Issues & Suggestions:**

*   The file content is minimal. Consider adding more context or details about the test event for better traceability and debugging.
*   Recent file system activity indicates frequent modifications to `tools/test_gemini_bridge.zsh` and creation of session files in `g/reports/sessions`. This suggests active testing. Ensure these tests are producing meaningful results and that session data is being appropriately managed.
*   The timestamp in the test event does not correspond to current reports creation time, which may be the intention, but is worth noting.
