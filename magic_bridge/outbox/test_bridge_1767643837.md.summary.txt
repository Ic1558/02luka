**Summary:** The file `test_bridge_1767643837.md` was updated to include the timestamp "Test event created at 2026-01-06 03:10:46".

**Potential Issues/Suggestions:**

*   This update seems to simply log an event timestamp. Consider whether this timestamp is sufficient for debugging or requires additional contextual information about the event being tested.
*   Recent filesystem activity shows modifications to `test_gemini_bridge.zsh` alongside creation of session files in `g/reports/sessions`. Suggests a testing or reporting script is being modified and run. Check the script modifications in `test_gemini_bridge.zsh` for unintended side effects.
