Okay, I will analyze the `secret_config.py` file within the provided project structure.

The `secret_config.py` file defines configuration settings for an API, including the API endpoint and a timeout value. A comment indicates that the timeout value is intended to be increased before deploying to production.

Summary:

*   `API_ENDPOINT`: Sets the base URL for an API. It's currently pointing to a fake server.
*   `TIMEOUT`: Defines a timeout duration for API requests, currently set to 30 seconds. A `TODO` comment suggests that it should be changed to 60 seconds before a production deployment.
