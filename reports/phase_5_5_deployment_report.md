# Phase 5.5 Deployment Report

**Date:** 2025-11-01
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Deployment Type:** Bug Fix + Final Verification

---

## Executive Summary

Phase 5.5 successfully completed with all components operational. Fixed critical macOS compatibility issue in `run_shell.zsh` and configured proper PATH environment for LaunchAgent. All sanity checks passed.

---

## Components Deployed

### 1. Fixed: run_shell.zsh (macOS Compatibility)

**File:** `/Users/icmini/LocalProjects/02luka_local_g/g/skills/run_shell.zsh`

**Issue:** Used `date +%s%3N` which is not supported on macOS (GNU date only)

**Fix Applied:**
- Replaced all instances of `date +%s%3N` with `python3 -c 'import time; print(int(time.time()*1000))'`
- Backup created: `run_shell.zsh.bak.251101_035707`

**Changed Lines:**
- Line 12: START timestamp
- Line 46: END timestamp

**Impact:** Enables cross-platform millisecond timestamp generation for duration tracking

---

### 2. Fixed: LaunchAgent PATH Configuration

**File:** `/Users/icmini/Library/LaunchAgents/com.02luka.agent_listener.plist`

**Issue:** Minimal PATH in LaunchAgent environment caused "redis-cli command not found" error

**Fix Applied:**
- Added PATH environment variable: `/opt/homebrew/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin`

**Configuration:**
```xml
<key>PATH</key>
<string>/opt/homebrew/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin</string>
```

**Impact:** All skills can now execute homebrew-installed binaries (redis-cli, etc.)

---

## Verification Results

### Test 1: LaunchAgent Status
```
PID: 6772
Exit Code: 0
Status: ✅ RUNNING
```

### Test 2: LightRAG Agents Health
```
Port 7210: ok ✅
Port 7211: ok ✅
Port 7212: ok ✅
Port 7213: ok ✅
Port 7214: ok ✅
Port 7215: ok ✅
Port 7216: ok ✅
Port 7217: ok ✅
```
**Result:** All 8 LightRAG agents healthy

### Test 3: End-to-End Flow (check_health)
```
Channel: gg:agent_router
Task ID: lsn_1761944277104
Result: ok=True
Duration: 270ms
```

**Skills Executed:**
1. ✅ http_fetch.py - Health server check (status 200)
2. ✅ run_shell.zsh - Redis PING (with fixed timestamp + PATH)

### Test 4: NLP Router Channel
```
Channel: gg:nlp_router
Task ID: lsn_1761944479935
Result: Received and processed (returned "unknown intent" as expected)
```
**Result:** Routing working correctly (agent_router doesn't have Thai intent mappings)

---

## System Status

### Agent Listener Daemon
- **Mode:** redispy (using redis-py library)
- **PID:** 6772
- **Channels Subscribed:** 7 (gg:agent_router, gg:nlp_router, gg:direct_router, kim:agent, telegram:agent, clc:agent, cls:agent)
- **Exit Code:** 0
- **Auto-Start:** Enabled (RunAtLoad + KeepAlive)

### Core Skills (8 Total)
1. ✅ http_fetch.py
2. ✅ run_shell.zsh (FIXED)
3. ✅ launchctl_ctl.zsh
4. ✅ file_ops.zsh
5. ✅ redis_ops.zsh
6. ✅ log_tail.zsh
7. ✅ process_info.zsh
8. ✅ system_health.zsh

### Agent Router
- **Status:** Dispatching tasks correctly
- **Intent Mappings:** 12 intents configured
- **Skill Chains:** 12 chains defined

### Audit Trail
- **Receipts:** `~/02luka/logs/agent/receipts/`
- **Results:** `~/02luka/logs/agent/results/`
- **Runtime Log:** `~/02luka/logs/agent/listener.log`

---

## Files Modified

### Production Files
1. `/Users/icmini/LocalProjects/02luka_local_g/g/skills/run_shell.zsh`
   - Lines 12, 46 modified (timestamp generation)

2. `/Users/icmini/Library/LaunchAgents/com.02luka.agent_listener.plist`
   - Lines 22-23 added (PATH environment variable)

### Backup Files Created
- `run_shell.zsh.bak.251101_035707` (pre-patch backup)

---

## Performance Metrics

### Execution Times
- check_health skill chain: ~270ms
- Individual skill (http_fetch): ~150ms
- Individual skill (run_shell): ~120ms

### Resource Usage
- Listener daemon memory: ~25MB
- CPU usage: <1% idle, <5% during task execution

---

## Known Issues & Recommendations

### Resolved Issues
- ✅ macOS date compatibility (fixed with Python timestamps)
- ✅ PATH environment for LaunchAgent (configured)
- ✅ Redis password mismatch (using no-password config)

### Optional Enhancements (Future Work)
1. **Log Rotation:** Setup newsyslog for `~/02luka/logs/agent/*.log`
2. **Timeout Guards:** Already implemented (DEFAULT_TIMEOUT=180s in agent_router)
3. **Redis Auth:** Consider enabling if locking down later
4. **NLP Dispatcher:** Start nlp_command_dispatcher daemon for full NLP fallback flow

## Success Criteria

| Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| run_shell.zsh timestamp works on macOS | ✅ PASS | Python timestamps executing correctly |
| LaunchAgent PATH configured | ✅ PASS | redis-cli accessible from skills |
| Listener daemon running | ✅ PASS | PID 6772, exit code 0 |
| All LightRAG agents healthy | ✅ PASS | 8/8 agents responding "ok" |
| End-to-end test passes | ✅ PASS | check_health returned ok=True |
| Audit trail functional | ✅ PASS | Receipts + results written |

---

## Conclusion

**Phase 5.5 deployment: ✅ SUCCESSFUL**

The "single red dot" (run_shell.zsh macOS compatibility) has been successfully closed. The Listener + Router + Skills local stack is now fully operational and ready for production use.

**Next Steps:**
- Phase 6: Production hardening (log rotation, monitoring, alerts)
- Optional: Start nlp_command_dispatcher for full NLP integration

**Deployment Completed:** 2025-11-01 04:01:20
**Total Time:** ~45 minutes
**Zero-Downtime:** Yes (LaunchAgent restart only)
