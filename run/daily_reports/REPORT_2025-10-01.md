| Time (ICT) | Hash | Author | Subject |

| 2025-10-01 01:07 | f864998 | icmini | Codex scaffolding ready: PREPROMPT, guardrails, preflight; mapping v1.0 OK; resolver + drift guard |

## Key changes
- **.codex** – Established PREPROMPT, CONTEXT_SEED, PATH_KEYS, GUARDRAILS, TASK_RECIPES, and codex.env.yml to formalize agent conduct and environment expectations; rerun `.codex/preflight.sh` after pulling to ensure compliance (**re-run required**).
- **g/tools** – Introduced `g/tools/path_resolver.sh` and `g/tools/mapping_drift_guard.sh` so workflows can translate logical keys and detect mapping drift early.
- **f/ai_context** – Added `f/ai_context/mapping.json` as the canonical key→path lookup powering the new resolver tooling.

## Follow-ups / TODO
- Run `.codex/preflight.sh` and address any reported setup gaps before executing tasks.
- Validate workspace mappings with `g/tools/mapping_drift_guard.sh --validate` and monitor for drift each deployment.
- Document resolver usage patterns in developer onboarding and update examples referencing the new mapping file.
- Automate daily report generation to prevent manual drift and ensure future coverage of all commits.
- Review the new reporting process and integrate it with existing operational checklists.

## Quick Runbook
### Run API/UI
- API: `bash g/tools/path_resolver.sh boss:api` (resolve target) then start service per resolved path instructions.
- UI: `./run_local.sh` to launch the local interface at http://localhost:8080.
- Remote access: `./tunnel` to create and refresh externally accessible URLs.
- Health checks: `./verify_system.sh` before exposing services publicly.

### Next 5 actions
1. Pull latest changes and rerun `.codex/preflight.sh`.
2. Execute `g/tools/mapping_drift_guard.sh --validate` and capture the results in run logs.
3. Test `g/tools/path_resolver.sh` against key paths (e.g., `human:inbox`, `reports.system`).
4. Update onboarding/docs with resolver + guardrail instructions and link to this report.
5. Schedule tomorrow's report generation and confirm stakeholders receive it.
