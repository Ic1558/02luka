## Ops Atomic Deployment Gate

The `ops-gate` job in CI checks the Ops Atomic summary endpoint and blocks merges if failures are reported.

### Required Secrets

- `OPS_ATOMIC_URL`: The endpoint URL (e.g., `https://boss-api.ittipong-c.workers.dev`)
- `OPS_ATOMIC_TOKEN`: Authentication token (if required)

### Required Variables

- `OPS_GATE_OVERRIDE`: Set to `1` to bypass the gate (emergency use only)

### Configuration

1. Set the secrets in GitHub repository settings
2. Set the variables in GitHub repository settings
3. The `ops-gate` job will automatically run on PRs and pushes

### Troubleshooting

- If the gate fails, check the `OPS_ATOMIC_URL` endpoint
- Use `OPS_GATE_OVERRIDE=1` to bypass in emergencies
- Check the CI logs for detailed error messages
